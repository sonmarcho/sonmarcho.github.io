A few years ago I adopted the habit
of practicing a personal activity every day, or at least 
once a week when I'm busy.
I regularly go back and forth between pursuing new interests and
rekindling old passions, but I always
practice with dedication to learn long-lasting skills.

The passion I originally had for [drawing](#fine_arts)
quickly grew to [computer graphics](#computer_graphics),
which in turn is the [reason why I discovered computer
programming](https://github.com/Kachoc/CrowdEngine).
I recently learnt to play the piano and am currently working hard to
[learn Chinese](#chinese).

## Fine Arts <a name="fine_arts"></a>

I have always been fond of drawing but didn't practice with enough discipline
when I was in middle and high school.
Once a student at *École polytechnique*, I adopted a more regular practice by
joining the fine arts association. I then spent most of my time experimenting
and trying to use colors, and had a hard time finding a technique which suited
me.
I didn't manage to make much of oil pastel and
oil paint, though I intend to give another shot at oil paint, and was not
convinced by acrylic. As a result, I didn't improve my skills much during this
period.

After my graduation, I discovered soft pastel and immediately became fond of
this technique. It really feels like drawing, but with colors, and thus seemed
very natural. It is also very
easy to fix a mistake or blend colors, leading to a lot of freedom, and the only
major drawback is the
fragility of the result - I'm actually having a hard time storing my drawings.

  <div style="background: lightgray; border: 2px solid gray;">
  <div style="margin: 15px;">
  <b>The popularisation of pastel in the 18<sup>th</sup> century</b>, the golden
  age of pastel, was
  actually greatly facilitated by the invention of two efficient preservation
  techniques: fixative, which would be spread on the back of a drawing to hold
  pastel powder in place, and flat glass, to cover paintings and drawings.

  I often read that a good way of redoing part of a pastel
  drawing is to use an eraser.
  I'm not very fond of this technique, and prefer
  using a bruch with stiff hair. Using a brush is a lot more precise,
  allowing you to remove pastel exactly where you need to and
  thus without the risk of damaging the surrounding areas.
  It also works
  well at removing the excess of pastel once the paper has reached
  saturation. As all the layers of pastel powder blend a bit, by gently
  scratching the surface you can
  reveal one of the inner layers, which in practice is often similar to the
  top one. This allows you to desaturate the paper without destroying your work,
  leaving room for corrections.
  </p>

  <p>
  I sometimes quickly sketch the model I'm drawing by using
  colored pencils, before working with pastels sticks. I once encountered the
  issue that depending on the pencils used, it is not always possible to cover their
  strokes with pastel. I now choose my pencils with a lot of care whenever I do so.
  </p>

  <p>
  When doing pastel, I love working with Sennelier's pastel card, but it may be
  expensive. I once found by luck a small stock of recycled paper for art,
  which proved perfect for pastel: the touch is very pleasant, it retains pastel
  well and has a very high level of saturation. Also, it is less abrasive than
  pastel card, thus preserving your pastel sticks. I also had a try at doing my
  own paper with powder of pumice stone, but I need to improve my
  technique because the result is a bit uneven so far.

In parallel, I also explored techniques like ink or gouache. I didn't spend as
much time as I would have liked on gouache, but I like this technique a lot.
Though the material is not as beautiful and noble as oil, it is a very
interesting technique because by drying fast it allows one to work quickly, and
it gives interesting tranparency effects.
Any mistake can also be reworked, contrary to
watercolor for which you need to adopt a completely different philosophy by
accepting the lack of control. Another
advantage over pastel is that, gouache being a paint, you don't need a huge
collection of tubes to work because you can derive what you need by mixing
pigments - you do the same with pastel, but directly on the canvas, making it
more difficult to control the effect.

After a lot of practice with pastel I became hindered by my drawing skills,
and decided to work on it it by progressively switching back to drawing without
colors, or with only a few.
I spent a lot of time playing with different types of pencil or even
with felt pens.
At some point, I
particularly enjoyed sketching with *pierre noire*, because it produces
interesting effects and allows me to work faster than with pencil. I also loved
practicing the [*trois-crayons*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trois_crayons)
technique (3-pencils: *pierre noire*, sanguine, white, usually applied on a
mid-tone paper), a technique dating from the 16<sup>th</sup> century, which was
intensively used to make portraits.

I generally work from a real model rather than from a photography, because it
trains the ability to see in space and often leads to
more lively results.
It also has advantages, like the possibility of moving
around, getting closer, seeing the model from a different perspective in order
to comprehend it better. I particularly enjoy drawing from statues in museums, or
going to the *Jardin des Plantes* to draw real, living animals.
I either wait for them to repeatedly go to the same position when they wander
around or circle in their enclosures, at which point I quickly add more strokes
to my sketch, or just try to capture the idea of their movement when they move
too much (damn monkeys...).
I also love going to live model sessions in Montmartre or elsewhere, especially
with friends.

Lately, I've focused on drawing with simple pencils because it is very
demanding.
While you can easily get interesting effects with techniques like
charcoal or pierre noire, pencils are very neutral and, in a
way, lack personality. If you draw a stroke with pierre noire, the stroke is
interesting in itself and can give strength to your drawing. On the contrary,
there is nothing more boring than a pencil stroke.
Using pencils thus takes more time and
forces you to be extremely strict and rigorous, but on the other hand gives you
a lot of control and leads to very subtle and interesting results. It also makes
you learn a lot - a lot more than the other techniques.

  <b>Whenever I need to buy art material, I go to
  <a href="https://www.magasinsennelier.art"><i>Sennelier</i></a></b>, at quai
  Voltaire in Paris, a historical store dating from 1887. Sennelier is also a
  brand, and a good one, as the founder Gustave Sennelier, who had a training 
  in chemistry, started his shop by creating his own colors for
  artists. Most of my pastel sticks are actually from Sennelier.

  <p>
  I particularly like the place because of its atmosphere, and whenever one of
  my friends wants to start drawing or painting I take she/him there to get
  her/him set up. The place is a bit of a mess, and immediately
  upon entering you only see piles and piles of art supplies from the floor to
  the ceiling. The shop is not big, but the selection is huge: it is
  more complete and diverse and actually cheaper than many other, bigger shops I
  went to. While I don't like shopping very much, I love going there just
  to "dig" and look for interesting 
  things. Of course, I always end up buying something I didn't came for.
  </p>
 
  <p>
  The people working there are also very nice and know a lot about the products
  they sell, meaning they always give good advice whenever you need some.
  For me, going there is a bit like 
  going to Shakespeare and Company for someone who loves English literature.

  <b>My favourite museum is the <i>musée d'Orsay</i></b>, in Paris. I love the paintings,
  and I used to go there with friends to draw the sculptures as they have an
  extremely good sculptures collection.
  There is a nearby café,
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/88HS7utGMKwo4WFL9"><i>Les Deux Musées</i></a>,
  where we would go after the drawing session to chat a bit - as a side note:
  their hot chocolate with cream is marvelous.

I particularly love playing with shader graphs to get interesting results. It

## Chinese <a name="chinese"></a>
I lived in Shanghai in 2019, which allowed me to discover the Chinese culture
and, more specifically, the Chinese language. I fell in love with this language,
and since then have been practicing with diligence.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px">

Chinese in kilometers of copied characters
</figcaption>
</div>
<div style="clear: both"></div>

While it is easy to learn Chinese in China, I had to adapt a bit once I was back in
France to build a proper learning environment. My way of doing it: Chinese class
once a week, tandems with some Chinese partners at
least twice a week, a bit of reading,
and Chinese TV series when I have spare time.
I used to learn vocabulary with the flash cards application
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), but have stopped because it proved quite
inefficient.
I always focus on tandems when I don't have much time, because I think
practicing conversation is by far the most useful, and it is also a lot of fun.
Note that it is easy to find partners
on applications like [Tandem](https://www.tandem.net).

About TV series, I started with
[致我们单纯的小美好](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I1SPKwTXJ0)
and am now watching [大江大河](https://youtu.be/o_IGbDIEOjo).
I'm usually not fond of sickeningly sweet and romantic dramas like
致我们单纯的小美好, but at
least it is easy to understand so I recommend it for a start.
I definitely recommend 大江大河.
Besides, I also heard a lot about the costume drama
[琅琊榜](https://youtu.be/xEdMFMLe3_o), which had a lot success in China due to
its rich and complex plot. It is good to watch (I love the
[credits song](https://youtu.be/qzB1yoGgcoo), by the way), but not that useful to 
study Chinese unless you want to learn a lot of old and specific terms, as well as all
the possible ways of addressing someone at the imperial court (殿下, 陛下,
whatever...).

I've recently discovered the science fiction author Liu Cixin (刘慈欣) and
really love his books. If you don't know where to start, I recommend his short
novel *The Wandering Earth* (流浪地球 - don't watch the movie).
Reading proved to be my most efficient way of acquiring vocabulary.
As finding Chinese books can be difficult outside of China
and importing them is quite expensive, I buy ebooks on my Kobo reader.
Even online, I sometimes have trouble finding mainland books and thus often end
up buying the Taiwanese version (i.e.: with traditional characters),
but as I intend to learn calligraphy I guess it is for the best...

Also, I loved going to KTVs while in Shanghai, and ended up knowing a small
repertoire of Chinese songs. My favourites:
[小幸运](https://youtu.be/Kg-mW8SyNVg) (the movie is cute, by the way),
[小苹果](https://youtu.be/Hpnub-uM6eo) (stupid, but very fun),
[月亮代表我的心](https://youtu.be/51xS4yXbryc),
[童话](https://youtu.be/0FJ1BCbTlXg),
[平凡之路](https://youtu.be/NjTT5_RSkw4) (more generally, I really enjoy Pu
Shu/朴树's songs),
[十年](https://youtu.be/7OdargV9K88),
[夜空中最亮的星](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPnymcrXgX0),
[卡路里](https://youtu.be/3De50Nx1c5I),
[学猫叫](https://youtu.be/OHbwkZgkBIU) (don't ask why...),
[Superstar](https://youtu.be/gr5fNKK2FaA),
[刚好遇见你](https://youtu.be/aa2AhDaK_iY),
[那些年](https://youtu.be/KqjgLbKZ1h0) (I like the movie).
